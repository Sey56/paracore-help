Today, we at Paras Codarch are thrilled to announce the official launch of Paracore, a desktop application poised to revolutionize the way you approach Revit automation.

For years, I've looked for ways to incorporate a more iterative, **Dynamic Execution** approach into the automation process. While traditional development is ideal for enterprise-scale tools, I wanted to provide an additional, "design-centered" choice for practitioners.

Paracore expands the possibilities.

### What is Paracore?

Paracore is a desktop application that provides an integrated environment for executing and managing C# scripts for Autodesk Revit. It complements your active Revit session, allowing you to run scripts and see the results instantly, providing a fluid environment for experimentation.

Our philosophy is simple: empower practitioners to "do more" with the Revit API by offering a dynamic environment for script execution.

### Key Features

*   **Dynamic Script Execution:** Write and run C# scripts on the fly. See your changes in Revit immediately, allowing for a rapid and interactive development cycle.
*   **Integrated Script Management:** Say goodbye to scattered script files. Paracore provides a beautiful and efficient script gallery to organize, view, and manage all your personal and team automation scripts.
*   **Seamless Team Collaboration:** Paracore is built for teams. With built-in Git integration, you can version control your scripts, collaborate with colleagues, and ensure everyone is working with the latest and greatest tools.
*   **Parameter Presets:** Save and load different sets of parameters for your scripts. This is perfect for running the same script with different configurations, saving you time and reducing errors.

### Get Started Today

We believe Paracore will fundamentally change the way you think about Revit automation. It’s faster, more flexible, and more user-friendly.

Head over to our **[Documentation](/docs/intro)** to learn how to get started.

We can't wait to see what you create with Paracore!

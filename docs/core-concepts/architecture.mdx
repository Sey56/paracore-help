# System Architecture

Paracore is designed as a decoupled, high-performance ecosystem. This architecture provides a **Dynamic Execution Environment** that enables a rapid, iterative workflow for both human developers and AI agents.

## 🏗️ The Pillars of Paracore

### 1. Paracore Desktop App (The Control Center)
Built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tauri**, the desktop application handles the high-level management of your automation library.
- **Role**: Script discovery, parameter orchestration, and results visualization.
- **Benefit**: By running as a separate process, Paracore provides a responsive, web-speed UI that operates independently of Revit's performance cycles.

### 2. Paracore Local Backend (The Sidecar)
A lightweight **Python** and **FastAPI** application that runs as a sidecar to the desktop app on your local machine. It acts as the central intelligence and communication hub.
- **Role**: It acts as an API Gateway, translating the frontend's HTTP requests into gRPC calls for Revit. It also manages script discovery, local data persistence via a **SQLite database** (`%AppData%/Roaming/paracore-data/data/rap_local.db`), and the Paracore Agent's logic.
- **Benefit**: By offloading heavy logic and filesystem operations to a local Python process, the UI stays lightning-fast and the Revit add-in remains lightweight.

### 3. Paracore Revit Addin (The Host)
A lightweight plugin that sits inside Revit. It acts as the execution bridge, providing the necessary context for your logic to interact with the model.
- **Role**: It hosts a **gRPC server** inside Revit and manages Revit Transactions. Crucially, it embeds the **CoreScript Engine**, a powerful Roslyn-based compiler that enables dynamic, in-memory execution of C# scripts.
- **Interactivity**: It enables high-performance, in-memory execution of C# scripts, allowing for rapid iteration and testing within the live Revit model.

## 📡 Responsive Communication

Paracore uses a high-speed **HTTP/gRPC** bridge to ensure communication between your code, the UI, and Revit happens in milliseconds.

### One Source of Truth (Project Scaffolding)
In V4, Paracore establishes a permanent link between your script source and your development environment.
- **In-Place Scaffolding**: When editing a script, Paracore scaffolds the necessary C# project files directly into the script's folder.
- **Integration**: This model allows you to leverage the full power of VS Code (IntelliSense, Debugging) on the actual source files that Revit executes, ensuring perfect synchronization without the need for periodic file-watching cycles.
- **Cleanliness**: Files are organized with executable logic in the `Scripts/` folder, keeping your library tidy while providing a full professional IDE context.

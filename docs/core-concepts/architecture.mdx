# System Architecture

Paracore is designed as a decoupled, high-performance ecosystem. This architecture provides a **Dynamic Execution Environment** that enables a rapid, iterative workflow for both human developers and AI agents.

## 🏗️ The Pillars of Paracore

### 1. Paracore Desktop App (The Control Center)
Built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tauri**, the desktop application handles the high-level management of your automation library.
- **Role**: Script discovery, parameter orchestration, and results visualization.
- **Benefit**: By running as a separate process, Paracore provides a responsive, web-speed UI that operates independently of Revit's performance cycles.

### 2. Paracore Local Server (The Sidecar)
A lightweight **Python** and **FastAPI** application that runs as a sidecar to the desktop app. It acts as the central intelligence and communication hub.
- **Role**: It acts as an API Gateway, translating the frontend's HTTP requests into gRPC calls for Revit. It also manages script discovery, local data persistence (SQLite), and the Paracore Agent's logic.
- **Benefit**: By offloading heavy logic and filesystem operations to a local Python server, the UI stays lightning-fast and the Revit add-in remains lightweight.

### 3. Paracore Revit Addin (The Host)
A lightweight plugin that sits inside Revit. It acts as the execution bridge, providing the necessary context for your logic to interact with the model.
- **Role**: It hosts a **gRPC server** inside Revit and manages Revit Transactions. Crucially, it embeds the **CoreScript Engine**, a powerful Roslyn-based compiler that enables dynamic, in-memory execution of C# scripts.
- **Simplicity**: It removes the need for manual project setup, allowing you to run code instantly without deploying DLLs.

## 📡 Responsive Communication

Paracore uses a high-speed **HTTP/gRPC** bridge to ensure communication between your code, the UI, and Revit happens in milliseconds.

### File Watchers & Synchronization
Paracore maintains a live link between your **Temporary VS Code Workspaces** and your **Script Sources** using intelligent file watchers.
- **The Link**: This connection is established based on the script's name/path.
- **Renaming Rule**: To maintain synchronization, scripts should only be renamed while they are not actively being edited in VS Code. If a rename is necessary, closing and reopening the workspace ensures the name-based link is correctly re-established.

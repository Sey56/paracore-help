# Core Concepts

To get the most out of Paracore, it is helpful to understand the core principles that define its role as a dynamic automation layer within the Revit ecosystem.

## 🧠 Key Principles

### [System Architecture](./architecture.mdx)
Paracore uses a "Decoupled Architecture." This means the interface you use to manage scripts is separate from Revit itself. Learn why this makes your automation workflow more stable and prevents Revit from hanging.

### [Script Distribution Types](./script-types.md)
Understand the difference between a **Single-File Script** and a **Multi-File Script**. Learn how Paracore identifies your scripts within a Script Source and how to organize complex logic into folders.

### [The Parameter Engine](../scripting-reference/parameters.mdx)
Discover how Paracore "reads" your code to build a user interface automatically. This section explains how your C# properties turn into sliders, dropdowns, and Revit element pickers.

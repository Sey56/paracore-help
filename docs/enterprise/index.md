# Enterprise Roadmap

Paracore is evolving into a comprehensive ecosystem for AEC professionals. While the core execution engine remains local and free, the following features represent our vision for the future **Paracore Cloud** platform.

---

## ☁️ Paracore Cloud (Under Development)

The cloud platform will serve as the backbone for team collaboration and professional tool distribution.

### 🛒 The .ptool Marketplace
A dedicated marketplace where:
- **Authors** can publish and monetize their high-end `.ptool` automations.
- **Users** can discover, purchase, and instantly install verified tools for their Revit projects.

### 👥 Team & Workspace Management
Centralize your firm's standards by moving from local folders to cloud-synced Git workspaces.
- **Role-Based Access**: Assign `Admin`, `Developer`, and `User` roles to manage who can edit vs. who can only run scripts.
- **Enterprise Deployment**: Manage and sync your firm's entire script library across multiple offices and projects.

## 🤖 Advanced Automation (Under Development)

We are working on powerful new modes to orchestrate your automation library.

### Agentic Automation
Go beyond single-script execution. The AI Agent will be able to orchestrate multiple scripts to perform complex, multi-step tasks (e.g., "Analyze the model, identify missing rooms, and place them on the correct levels").

### Playlist Mode
The ability to queue and execute a sequence of scripts in a specific order, allowing for complex, standardized BIM workflows that can be shared across teams.

## 💡 Status
These features are currently in active development. We are testing the underlying infrastructure (such as the `rap-auth-server`) to ensure a secure and stable experience once launched.

*Stay tuned for updates as we continue to build the future of Revit automation.*

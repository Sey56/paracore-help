# Introduction to Paracore

This documentation will guide you through installing Paracore, understanding its core features, collaborating with your team, and leveraging its full potential to enhance your Revit workflows.

Paracore offers three complementary modes of automation to suit your needs:

*   **Manual Automation:** Browse the library, select existing scripts, configure parameters, and execute them. You can also create new scripts from templates (single or multi-file), saving them to your active script source.
    *   **VSCode Integration:** A core feature of RAP is the deep integration with VSCode. Click "Edit in VSCode" on any script to launch a temporary workspace with full IntelliSense, code completion, and access to custom global variables, making script development powerful and efficient.
*   **AI Script Generation:** Describe a task in natural language, and let Paracore's AI generate the C# code for you. You can preview, edit, and save these scripts to your library.
*   **Agentic Automation:** Chat with the Paracore Agent to describe complex workflows. The agent will understand your intent, find the right scripts, extract parameters from your conversation, and execute the work for you.

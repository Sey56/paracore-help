# Introduction to Paracore

**Paracore** is a professional-grade C# automation platform for Autodesk Revit. Born from an architect's passion for the Revit ecosystem, it serves as a high-performance **Dynamic Execution Layer** designed to expand the possibilities of design automation and provide a robust foundation for the future of AI-powered workflows.

## 🤝 A New Addition to Your Toolkit

The Revit ecosystem is powered by diverse and essential tools—from traditional Add-in development and Dynamo to pyRevit, RevitPythonShell, and Rhino.Inside.Revit. Paracore is designed to sit alongside these industry standards, providing a unique solution for those who need the power of C# with the speed of dynamic scripting.

Paracore brings the full power of the Revit API into a high-performance, dynamic environment, allowing you to move from logic to execution instantly.

### Key Strengths:
- **Full API Power**: Access every capability of the Revit API within a live, dynamic session.
- **Zero-Boilerplate Parameter Engine**: Turn C# code into tools instantly. Paracore automatically generates rich UI controls (dropdowns, sliders, validation) directly from your property definitions without any UI code.
- **Professional Authoring**: Leverage the full power of VS Code for script development, complete with IntelliSense and advanced debugging, while executing scripts directly in Revit.
- **Interactive Execution**: Refine your logic iteratively with a modern UI, real-time feedback, and deterministic results.
- **AI-Native Infrastructure**: Built for the AI era, providing the modular "tool" environment needed for agents to safely and effectively orchestrate Revit automation.

## 🏗️ Architecture at a Glance

Paracore consists of three primary layers working in harmony:

1.  **Paracore Revit Addin**: The execution host that lives inside Revit, providing the direct API context and execution engine.
2.  **Paracore Desktop App**: The modern user interface for script management, parameter configuration, and workflow orchestration.
3.  **Backend Sidecar**: The local backend service (FastAPI) that manages script discovery, agent logic, and handles communication between the desktop app and the Revit add-in.

# Introduction to Paracore

**Paracore** is a professional-grade C# automation platform for Autodesk Revit. It serves as a high-performance **Dynamic Execution Layer** that complements the existing Revit automation ecosystem, offering a streamlined workflow for computational designers, BIM managers, and developers.

## ð¤ A New Addition to Your Toolkit

The Revit ecosystem is powered by diverse and essential toolsâfrom traditional Add-in development and Dynamo to pyRevit, RevitPythonShell, and Rhino.Inside.Revit. Paracore is designed to sit alongside these industry standards, providing a unique solution for those who need the power of C# with the speed of dynamic scripting.

Paracore removes the setup friction often associated with C# development, allowing you to move from idea to execution without leaving your creative flow.

### Key Benefits:
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Focus strictly on your logic. Paracore handles the environment setup, Revit API pathing, and reference management automatically.
- **Instant Add-in Experience**: Turn any C# script into a professional tool. Paracore automatically generates a rich UI with dropdowns, sliders, and validation based on your code properties.
- **Zero-Boilerplate C#**: Use modern C# top-level statements to write clean, modular logic that runs instantly within the live Revit session.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Refine your code iteratively with a modern UI, real-time console, and rich data visualization tools.
- **AI-Native Infrastructure**: Built for the modern AI era, Paracore provides the dynamic environment needed for AI agents to execute scripts as modular "tools," bridging the gap between LLMs and the Revit API.

## ðï¸ Architecture at a Glance

Paracore consists of three primary layers working in harmony:

1.  **Paracore Revit Addin**: The execution host that lives inside Revit, providing the direct API context and execution engine.
2.  **Paracore Desktop App**: The modern user interface for script management, parameter configuration, and workflow orchestration.
3.  **Backend Sidecar**: The local backend service (FastAPI) that manages script discovery, agent logic, and handles communication between the desktop app and the Revit add-in.

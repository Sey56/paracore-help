# Tutorials

Learn how to build powerful Revit automations using Paracore through these step-by-step guides.

## 🚀 The "Clone & Follow" Strategy

To ensure you have the best experience, we recommend using our official **Paracore Examples** library while following these tutorials.

1.  **Clone the Repo**: Download or clone the [Paracore-Examples](https://github.com/Sey56/Paracore-Examples) repository.
2.  **Add Script Sources**: In the Paracore Sidebar, click the **"+"** button and add both the **`01_Getting_Started`** and **`03_Tutorials`** folders.
3.  **Follow Along**: Each tutorial will refer to a specific file within these folders.

> 🛡️ **Safety First: Use Sample Projects**
> We highly recommend testing these tutorials in a **sample or dummy Revit project** (e.g., the Revit Basic Sample Project) rather than a live production model.

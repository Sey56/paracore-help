# Gallery Mastery

As your script library grows, organization becomes key. Today we learn how to master the Paracore Gallery to keep your high-end automation tools easy to find.

## 1. Organizing with Folders
Paracore can source scripts from anywhere. 
-   **Local Folders**: Add any folder on your computer as a script source. 
-   **Workspaces**: Connect to GitHub repositories to share scripts with your team.
-   **Pro-Tip**: Use the **Sidebar** to toggle between different sources instantly.

## 2. Using Gallery Filters (v3 Exclusive)
With our new v3 toolbar, you can instantly declutter your view:
-   **All**: Shows everything in the current source.
-   **Single-File**: Filters for high-efficiency `.cs` scripts.
-   **Multi-File**: Shows only complex modular projects (folders with a `Main.cs`).

## 3. Native Renaming
Need to reorganize your script names? 
1.  Click the **eclipses (...)** on any script card.
2.  Select **Rename**.
3.  Paracore will automatically update the file on your disk and refresh the metadata instantly.

## 4. Focus Mode (The "Hero" Experience)
When you're ready to run a script, click the **Focus Mode** icon (the double-square). 
This isolates the script UI into a beautiful, centered overlay, hiding all other gallery clutter. This is the professional way to execute automation without distractions.

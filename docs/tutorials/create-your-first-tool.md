# Tutorial 5: Create Your First Tool

Turn your `FloorGenerator` script into a protected product.

## 🎯 Objective
Compile the Multi-File script from Tutorial 4 into a `.ptool`.

## Steps

1.  **Locate**: Find your `FloorGenerator` script in the Gallery.
2.  **Open Viewer**: Go to the **Parameters Tab** and click the **View Code** icon to open the Floating Code Viewer.
3.  **Build**: Click the **Build Protected Tool** button at the bottom of the code window.
4.  **Confirm**: The `.ptool` file is automatically generated in the same folder as your script.

## Verification
You should now see an **Amber** card in your Gallery named `FloorGenerator`. It works exactly like the source script, but the code is now hidden and protected!

# Script Gallery

The **Script Gallery** is the central hub for browsing and launching your automation library. It displays the contents of your **Active Script Source**.

<img src={GalleryMain} alt="Script Gallery Main" />

## 📂 Active Script Source

Paracore allows you to load multiple **Script Sources** (folders) into your library, but the Gallery focuses on one source at a time.

### The "Local Folders" Dropdown
Located in the Sidebar, this dropdown acts as your library switcher:
-   **Switching**: Selecting a different folder from the dropdown instantly repopulates the Gallery with that folder's contents.
-   **Isolation**: This ensures that scripts from different projects or sources don't clutter your view.
-   **Persistence**: Paracore remembers your loaded folders across sessions.

## ✏️ Native Renaming

You can rename any script (Single-file or Multi-file) directly from the Gallery using the **Rename** button on the script card.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Renaming & VS Code Sync**
>
> Paracore links your temporary VS Code workspace to your script via its **Name**. If you rename a script while a workspace is already open, the synchronization link will break.
>
> **The Safe Renaming Workflow:**
> 1. **Close the Workspace**: In VS Code, close the folder or the instance containing the script's temporary workspace.
> 2. **Rename in Paracore**: Click the Rename button and enter the new name.
> 3. **Re-edit**: Click **Edit Script** again to re-establish the sync link.

## 🏷️ Category Filtering

Filtering relies entirely on the `Categories` field in your [Script Metadata](./metadata.md).

### 1. Default Category Checkboxes (Header)
The top of the gallery provides three "Quick Isolation" checkboxes: **Architecture**, **Structure**, and **MEP**.
-   **Logic**: Checking a box immediately isolates scripts that have that specific category in their metadata.

### 2. Custom Categories
Use the **"+"** button under **Custom Categories** in the Sidebar to create your own filters. Once added, you can toggle them on or off with a single click.

## 🔍 Advanced Search & Pills

The search bar supports advanced prefix-based queries. When you enter a valid search term, Paracore creates a **Search Pill**.

<img src={SearchPills} alt="Search Pills" />

### Search Prefixes
| Prefix | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `author:` | Filter by script author | `author:John` |
| `categories:` | Filter by any category | `categories:Audit` |
| `param:` | Search scripts with specific parameters | `param:Width` |

## 🎯 Focus Mode

**Focus Mode** centers the selected script and hides the rest of the gallery, providing a distraction-free environment for repetitive execution.

### How to enter Focus Mode:
1.  Locate the **Focus Action Button** (🎯) at the bottom-right of any script card in the gallery.
2.  Hover over it to see the **"Focus View"** tooltip.
3.  Click the button to isolate the script.

### How to exit Focus Mode:
1.  While in Focus Mode, locate the **Exit Focus** button at the bottom-right of the enlarged script card (in the same position as the entry button).
2.  Hover over it to see the **"Exit focus mode"** tooltip.
3.  Click it to return to the full gallery.

## 🗂️ Script Types

The footer toolbar allows you to toggle between different script distribution types:
-   **All**: Every script available in the current source.
-   **Single**: Standalone `.cs` files.
-   **Multi**: Folder-based modular projects (indicated by a blue left border).
-   **Tool**: Protected `.ptool` files (indicated by an amber right border).

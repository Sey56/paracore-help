# AI-Powered Debugging

Paracore includes a built-in AI assistant designed to help you debug Revit API scripts in seconds. This feature, known as **Explain & Fix**, uses an LLM (Large Language Model) to analyze execution errors and suggest immediate code corrections.

## 🛠️ The "Explain & Fix" Workflow

When a script fails to execute or compile, a red **Explain & Fix** button appears on the **far left** of the **Console Tab** footer. Clicking this button initiates the following process:

### 1. Analysis
The AI scans your execution environment. It distinguishes between **Single-File Scripts** and **Multi-File Scripts**. 
- For multi-file scripts, it analyzes the entire folder context to understand how your classes and entry points interact.

### 2. Explanation
In the **Explain & Fix window**, the AI provides a natural language summary of why the code failed.
- It translates complex Revit API or C# exceptions into simple, easy-to-understand explanations.
- It identifies the specific line and file where the error occurred.

### 3. Suggested Correction
The AI generates a complete rewrite of the affected file(s). 
- **Code View**: You will see the filename followed by the full, corrected code in a syntax-highlighted editor.
- **Review**: The code is read-only, allowing you to review the AI's logic before committing the change.

### 4. Direct Application
Click the **Apply Fix** button to commit the changes. Paracore handles the file synchronization intelligently:

- **If a Temporary Workspace is open**: The fix is applied to the copied script in the temporary workspace. Paracore's file watchers then instantly sync this change back to your original script in the **Script Source**. This ensures your IntelliSense and the execution engine stay in perfect harmony.
- **If no Workspace is open**: The fix is applied directly to the original script file in your library.

In both cases, once you click **Apply Fix**, you can immediately return to the **Parameters Tab** and click **Run Script** again to verify the solution.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Connectivity

### Connectivity & Configuration
This feature requires an active internet connection and configured LLM settings in the **Settings** menu.

- **Supported Providers**: Currently, only **Google Gemini** (models **2.5 and 3.0**) and **OpenRouter** are fully implemented.
- **Other Providers**: While Anthropic, DeepSeek, and OpenAI are listed in the settings menu, they are not yet active and will be supported in future updates.

### ⚠️ Data Privacy & Usage Advisory

When you use **Explain & Fix**, your **script source code** and error logs are transmitted to the active AI provider (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI) for analysis.

-   **Educational Use Only**: This feature is intended for **Learning** and debugging standard Revit API workflows.
-   **Proprietary Code Warning**: If you are working on confidential, proprietary, or trade-secret algorithms, we **do not recommend** using this feature, as third-party providers may use submitted data for model training depending on their policies.
-   **Your Risk**: Use this feature with the understanding that you are sharing your code logic with the AI provider.

*Note: Your **Revit Model Data** (geometry, element parameters, project files) remains **entirely local** and is never transmitted to the cloud.*

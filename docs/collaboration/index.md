# Collaboration with RAP

RAP is designed to facilitate seamless collaboration within AEC firms, allowing teams to share, manage, and develop automation scripts together. This is achieved through a powerful Git-powered workflow that leverages industry-standard practices.

## Why Collaborate with RAP?

*   **Centralized Script Management:** Keep all your team's automation scripts in version-controlled Git repositories.
*   **Role-Based Access:** Define clear responsibilities with distinct roles for users, developers, and administrators.
*   **Consistent Workflows:** Enforce best practices for Git, ensuring a stable and reliable script library.
*   **Data Integrity:** Protect your `main` branch from accidental changes, ensuring that end-users always receive tested and approved scripts.
*   **Scalability:** Easily onboard new team members and scale your automation efforts as your firm grows.

## Key Concepts

Collaboration in RAP revolves around a few key concepts:

*   **Teams:** Groups of users working together on shared automation goals.
*   **User Roles:** Defined permissions and responsibilities within a team (`admin`, `developer`, `user`).
*   **Workspaces:** Git repositories registered with RAP that serve as the source for team scripts.
*   **Git Workflow:** The process of using Git for version control, branching, and merging changes.

This section of the documentation will guide you through understanding these concepts and effectively collaborating with your team using RAP.

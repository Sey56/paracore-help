# Paracore v3.0.0 "Gold" Release 🏮🚀

Welcome to Paracore v3.0! This release marks our transition into a Long Term Support (LTS) environment for professional C# automation in Revit.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 🏛️ Professional "Batteries-Included" Libraries
We have integrated industrial-standard libraries directly into the Core engine for high-performance data and graphics processing:
- **`RestSharp`**: For connecting to modern web APIs.
- **`MiniExcel`**: For ultra-fast Excel processing (no Excel installation required).
- **`MathNet.Numerics`**: For advanced structural and statistical analysis.
- **`SixLabors.ImageSharp`**: For professional image processing within Revit.

### 🎯 Flagship Demonstration
Check out the new **`ParacoreTiler.cs`** script in the **`04_Advanced`** folder of the [Paracore-Examples](https://github.com/Sey56/Paracore-Examples) repository. It showcases:
- High-performance Boolean clipping against room geometry. 
- Adaptive gap-filling logic for architectural tiles.
- Real-time data visualization using structured output.

### 🎨 Total UI Overhaul
We have overhauled the interface for maximum comfort and productivity:
- **Focus Mode**: Minimize distractions and focus entirely on your code or parameters.
- **Enhanced Navigation**: A more intuitive Sidebar and a refined Parameters tab for faster configuration.
- **Modern Modals**: Redesigned dialogs and modals for a consistent, professional experience.

## 🛠️ Refinements & Stability
Version 3.0 focuses on hardening the communication between the C# Engine, the VS Code Extension, and the Paracore Dashboard.
- **Reliable IntelliSense**: Workspace initialization now better synchronizes with industry libraries.
- **Advanced Parameters**: Support for `[Mandatory]`, `[Unit]`, and `[Confirm]` attributes for safer script execution.

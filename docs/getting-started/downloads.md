Here you can find the necessary installers to get started with Paracore and its related tools. Please read the descriptions carefully to ensure you download the correct components for your workflow.

:::caution Important Installation Order
To use Paracore or the VSCode extension, you **must** first install the **Paracore Addin for Revit**.
:::

### 1. Paracore Addin for Revit

This is the essential Revit add-in that enables communication between Revit and Paracore (or the VSCode extension). It must be installed and running in Revit for any C# script execution to occur.

*   **File:** `Paracore_Revit_Installer.exe`
*   **Download:** [Paracore Addin Installer](https://github.com/Sey56/Paracore/releases)

### 2. Paracore UI (rap-web)

This is the main user-facing desktop application for managing, executing, and collaborating on Revit C# scripts. It requires the Paracore Addin to be installed in Revit.

*   **Version:** `v1.1.1` (Latest Stable)
*   **File:** `Paracore_Installer.msi`
*   **Download:** [Download Paracore v1.1.1](https://github.com/Sey56/Paracore/releases)

:::tip Recommended Update
If you were experiencing issues with parameter values or presets being lost during navigation, please download and install this latest version (`v1.1.1`).
:::

### 3. VSCode Extension (Optional)

This extension is for developers who prefer to write and execute C# scripts directly from Visual Studio Code, bypassing the rap-web application's script management features. It also requires the Paracore Addin to be installed in Revit.

*   **Version:** `v1.1.1` (Latest Stable)
*   **File:** `corescript-1.1.1.vsix`
*   **Download:** [VSCode Extension](https://github.com/Sey56/Paracore/releases)

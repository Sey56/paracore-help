Paracore has officially reached its "Gold" milestone. This version represents a fundamental shift towards **Focus & Agency**, providing a premium environment for professional Revit automation.

## 🛠️ Features at a Glance

### 1. 🎯 "Hero" Focus Mode
Selecting a script now isolates it into a distraction-free overlay.
-   **Absolute Isolation**: No more gallery scrolling or visual clutter.
-   **Centric Design**: Your active script is always mathematically centered.
-   **Premium Backdrop**: Features a modern, animated glassmorphic atmosphere.

### 2. 🔋 "Batteries-Included" Libraries
Paracore v3.0 now includes industry-standard libraries available globally in **every** script:
-   **MathNet.Numerics**: High-performance linear algebra, statistics, and mathematics.
-   **RestSharp**: Simple, professional logic for HTTP and REST API integrations.
-   **MiniExcel**: Blazing-fast Excel support without requiring local Office installations.
-   **ImageSharp**: Advanced image processing and pixel manipulation.

### 3. 🎨 v3 Rich Input Suite
We've expanded the Parameter Engine to support high-end design controls:
-   **Numerical Steppers**: Precision +/- controls for exact iteration counts.
-   **Color Pickers**: Visual hex selection for architectural design overrides.
-   **Segmented Toggles**: Modern horizontal buttons for clear option selection.

### 4. 🗂️ Gallery Organization & Toolbar
The gallery is now smarter and more organized:

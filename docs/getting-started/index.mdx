# Getting Started

Welcome to **Paracore**! This guide will help you get up and running in minutes, from initial installation to running your first high-performance Revit automation.

## 🚀 The Path to Success

1.  **[Installation & Setup](./installation.mdx)**: Set up the Addin, activate the server, and connect the Desktop app.
2.  **[Your First Script](./first-script.mdx)**: Execute a sample automation to verify your setup.
3.  **[Downloads](./downloads.md)**: Get the latest installers.

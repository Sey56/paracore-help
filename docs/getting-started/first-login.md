# First Login Guide

This guide will walk you through your initial login to the Revit Automation Platform (Paracore) and explain how your personal team space is set up.

## Logging In for the First Time

1.  **Launch the Paracore Application:** Open the Paracore desktop application (`Paracore.exe`).
2.  **Initiate Login:** You will be prompted to log in, typically via a Google OAuth process.
    *   Click the "Login with Google" button.
    *   Your system's default web browser will open, directing you to Google's authentication page.
3.  **Authenticate with Google:** Follow the prompts to log in with your Google account and grant the necessary permissions to Paracore.
4.  **Return to Paracore:** After successful authentication, your browser will redirect, and the Paracore application will automatically detect your successful login.

## Your Personal Team Space

Upon your very first successful login, the Paracore system automatically performs the following:

*   **User Registration:** Your user account is registered with the central `paracore-auth-server`.
*   **Personal Team Creation:** A dedicated **personal team** is created for you (e.g., "[Your Name]'s Space"). This is your private workspace within Paracore.
*   **Admin Role Assignment:** You are automatically assigned the `admin` role for your personal team. This gives you full control over your own scripts and team settings.

## What's Next?

Now that you're logged in and your personal team space is set up, you can start exploring Paracore:

*   **Explore the User Guide:** Learn how to navigate the Paracore interface and run scripts.
*   **Manage Your Team:** If you're an admin, you can invite other users to your team via the [Team Management section](../admin-guide/team-management.md).
*   **Register Workspaces:** As an admin, you can register Git repositories as team workspaces for collaboration.

# First Login Guide

This guide will walk you through your initial login to the Revit Automation Platform (Paracore) and explain how your personal team space is set up.

## Logging In for the First Time

1.  **Launch the Paracore Application:** Open the Paracore desktop application (`Paracore.exe`).
2.  **Continue Offline:** In the top bar, click the **"Continue Offline"** button.
    *   This will grant you immediate access to all local automation features.
    *   **Note:** You do not need to sign in with a Google account to use Paracore for local script execution.

> [!NOTE]
> Features that require cloud services, such as **Team Collaboration**, **Shared Workspaces**, and **AI Features**, are not available in Offline Mode. We recommend starting with Offline Mode to get familiar with the core automation capabilities.

## What's Next?

Now that you're ready to use Paracore, you can start exploring:

*   **Explore the User Guide:** Learn how to navigate the Paracore interface and run scripts.
*   **Load Local Folders:** You can load local folders using the Sidebar to access your personal collection of scripts.

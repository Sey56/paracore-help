# Admin Guide

As an `admin` in RAP, you play a crucial role in managing your team, curating the script library, and ensuring the overall health and governance of your firm's automation ecosystem. This guide provides detailed instructions on your responsibilities and how to perform key administrative tasks.

## Key Responsibilities of an Admin

*   **Team Management:** Invite new members, assign roles (`user`, `developer`, or `admin`), and remove users from your team.
*   **Workspace Registration:** Define and register remote Git repositories as team workspaces, making them available to all team members.
*   **Registered Workspace Management:** Delete registered workspaces from the team's list.
*   **Gatekeeper of Quality:** Oversee the quality and stability of automation scripts, often by managing the `main` branch of your team's Git repositories.
*   **Publishing Scripts:** Mark specific versions of scripts as "ready for production use," making them visible and available to all `user` roles.

## Admin Tools and Access

Admins have the most comprehensive access within RAP, including:

*   Full access to the script editor and development environment.
*   All Git integration features (commit, push, pull/sync, branch management).
*   Access to the "Team Management" and "Workspaces" tabs in the Settings modal.
*   Ability to load scripts from local folders for personal experimentation.

This section will detail how to perform these administrative tasks effectively.

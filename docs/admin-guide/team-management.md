# Team Management

As an `admin`, you are responsible for managing your team members and their roles within Paracore. This ensures that the right people have the right access to collaborate effectively.

## Inviting New Team Members

To invite new users to your team:

1.  **Access Team Management:** Navigate to the **Settings modal** (usually accessible via your profile in the Top Bar) and select the **"Team Management" tab**.
2.  **Enter Member Details:** In the invitation section, enter the email address of the user you wish to invite.
    *   **Prerequisite:** The user must already have a Paracore account (i.e., they must have signed in to Paracore at least once).
3.  **Assign a Role:** Select the desired role for the new member:
    *   **`user`:** Can run scripts, manage parameters, and update local clones.
    *   **`developer`:** Can create/edit scripts, use full Git workflow, and manage local clones.
    *   **`admin`:** Has all `developer` permissions, plus team and registered workspace management.
4.  **Send Invitation:** Click the "Invite" button.

The invited user will immediately become a member of your team with the assigned role. They will see your team listed in their Team Switcher.

## Changing Member Roles

You can modify the role of an existing team member:

1.  In the "Team Management" tab, locate the member whose role you wish to change.
2.  Use the role selection dropdown next to their name to choose a new role.
3.  The change will take effect immediately.

## Removing Team Members

To remove a user from your team:

1.  In the "Team Management" tab, locate the member you wish to remove.
2.  Click the "Remove" button (or similar icon) next to their name.
3.  Confirm the action if prompted.

Removing a member will revoke their access to your team's registered workspaces and scripts.

# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 25, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Paras Codarch ("we", "us", or "our") handles your data when you use the Paracore desktop application and its associated Revit add-in.

Paracore is designed with a **"Local-First"** architecture. We believe your automation scripts and project data should remain under your control.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 "Continue Offline" Mode (Core Experience)
When you use Paracore in "Continue Offline" mode (the standard Free tier), **we do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, project data, or automation scripts.**

*   **Scripts:** Your C# scripts reside 100% on your local file system. They are never uploaded to our servers.
*   **Revit Data:** All interactions with the Revit API happen locally on your machine. No model geometry or parameters are sent to the cloud.
*   **Usage Data:** We do not track your usage or script execution history.

### 1.2 Cloud Features (Currently Disabled/Unavailable)
Paracore includes infrastructure for cloud-based features such as AI Script Generation, Agentic Automation, and Team Management. **These features are currently disabled for the public release.**
*   The "Sign in with Google" functionality is present in the UI but is restricted.
*   No data is transmitted to our cloud authentication or AI services in the current public release.

---

## 2. Data Storage and Security

Because Paracore operates locally:
*   **Your Data**: Stays on your hard drive.
*   **Your Scripts**: Are stored in the local folders you specify or the Git repositories you manage.

You are responsible for backing up your own scripts and data (e.g., using GitHub, GitLab, or local backups).

---

## 3. Third-Party Services
The application may contain links to third-party websites or services (e.g., GitHub for documentation). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties.

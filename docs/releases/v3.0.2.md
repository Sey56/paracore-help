# Paracore v3.0.2 — Automatic Element Discovery

This release marks a fundamental shift in the Paracore engine, moving away from string-based lookups toward a professional, type-safe architecture that automatically discovers Revit elements for you.

## 🏛️ Major Architectural Shift

### 💎 Automatic Revit Discovery (The New Standard)
Paracore now speaks the native language of the Revit API. You can define your parameters using real Revit types, and the engine handles the rest automatically using reflection.
- **Direct Object Access**: Use `public Wall MyWall` or `public List<Room> MyRooms` directly in your `Params` class. This eliminates the need for manual `Doc.GetElement()` lookups or casting within your script logic.
- **Reflection-Based Discovery**: The engine uses C# reflection to discover elements. If your property type is a system class like `Level` or `WallType`, the dropdown will automatically populate as if by "Magic."
- **⚠️ Breaking Change**: Legacy string-based element extraction (where `[RevitElements]` was used on `string` properties) is replaced by this new automatic discovery system. While the `[RevitElements]` attribute is still required for loadable components (e.g., `Doors`) to specify the target category, the parameter must now be defined as a Revit class (e.g., `FamilyInstance`) rather than a string.

### ⚡ Reactive Custom Filtering
The "Compute" action logic is now **Reactive**. Your `_Options` providers now have access to the current state of other UI parameters.
- **Context-Aware Dropdowns**: Dynamically filter element lists in real-time based on the state of other parameters (like sliders or toggles).
- **Unit-Aware Hardening**: Parameters passed to `_Options` providers are automatically converted to Revit Internal Units, ensuring consistency with the main script execution.

## 🎨 UI & UX Improvements

### 🪄 Stateless Compute Action
- **Stale Value Prevention**: Clicking "Compute" now clears previous selections and reverts parameters to their defaults. This ensures a clean slate when switching between different Revit documents, preventing reference errors.
- **Document Context Awareness**: A new safety mechanism detects if your active computed parameters belong to a different project than the active document, prompting a refresh via an amber warning UI.

### 🏷️ Professional Identity Formatting
- **Smart Labels**: Element identities in dropdowns are now context-aware. Instance elements (Walls, Rooms) automatically include their **[ID]** to ensure uniqueness, while unique types (Levels, Materials) are displayed cleanly by name.
- **Sheet Standards**: ViewSheets now follow the `[Number] Name` format.

## 🛠️ Engine Hardening
- **Global Synchronization**: Aligned all execution paths (IntelliSense, Main Engine, and Options Executor) to use the same stabilized list of 20+ namespaces and libraries.
- **Code Leak Prevention**: Hardened the parameter extractor to prevent internal C# logic from appearing in user-facing UI labels.
